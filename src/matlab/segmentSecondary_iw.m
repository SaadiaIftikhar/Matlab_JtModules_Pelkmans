    % --------
    %
    %   SECONDARYLABELMATRIXIMAGE           Label image 
    %   EDITEDPRIMARYBINARYIMAGE            Label image  
    %   THRESHOLDARRAY                      Array of used threshold values
    %
    % Usage:
    % ------
    %
    % This module identifies secondary objects by sequential watershedding.
    % This allows to combine the advantage of a high threshold correction
    % factor (correct allocation of pixels to cells within crowded regions)
    % with the advantage of a low threshold correction factor (detection of
    % cellular periphery in sparse regions).
    %
    % To prevent false positives, if very few primary objects are present,
    % limits for threshold can be used.
    %
    %
    % SUGGESTION TO FIND MINIMAL BACKGROUND - ROBUST CAMERA / IMAGING
    % CONDITIONS
    % If using sCMOS cameras, the intensity value, which corresponds to
    % background signal from the chip is ~100 greyscale values. Distinctive
    % cell-specific signal from the cell outline stain can usually be detected
    % at ~125 greyscale values. The minimal background value thus corresponds
    % to 0.0019 (125/2^16)
    %
    % SUGGESTION TO FIND MINIMAL BACKGROUND - VIA IDENTIFYSECONDARY
    % Get lowest threshold, which does not yet recognize background as
    % cells.
    % Make a CP pipeline with several IdentifySecondary modules. In each one
    % select a different threshold correction value. Use OTSU GLOBAL and
    % WATERSHEDDING
    % Now start the pipeline. Of all modules, which do not recognize the
    % background, use the one with the smallest threshold correction value
    % (for us this is frequently around 0.5). Then manually write down the
    % exact threshold value of this module. It will be displayed in the
    % window opened by this module.
    %
    % Do not bother, whether the cells are correctly segmented.
    % The only important point is that the outline of the
    % cell has to be detected fully. Make sure that the test image is
    % representative of your assay. Usually spreading cells do require a much
    % lower threshold value than cells in crowded environments.
    %
    % SETTING UP THE IDENTIFYSECONDARYITERATIVE MODULE
    %
    % THRESHOLD CORRECTION FACTORS. IN DESCENDING RANKING.
    % Should indicate many different thresholds.
    % It starts with the most stringent and starts with the lowest.
    % The lowest one should be so low that it would recognize the
    % background as an object.
    %
    % Note that you do not care about:
    % x the number of thresholds. The more, the better. Use supercomputing.
    % Applying around 20 different ones usually gives very robust results. You
    % can not select too many thresholds. You can save days of manual work by
    % not selecting (a single) individual threshold(s).
    % x the specific value of the lowest threshold: The lowest value has to be
    % lower than the lowest threshold correction, which you tested previously.
    % It should be a threshold value that recognizes the background. The
    % separation from the background will be done by a later option. If the
    % last threshold correction value is too high, the periphery of spreading
    % cells might be missed.
    %
    % An example for the range would be 1.1 1.05 1 0.95 0.9 0.85 0.8 0.75 0.7
    % 0.6 0.58 0.55 0.50 0.45 0.4 0.35 0.3 0.25
    %
    % Usually the best gain in segmentation quality per threshold is achieved
    % with threshold correction factors close to the threshold correction
    % factor, which you would choose in the normal IdentifySecondary module
    %
    % LOWER AND UPPER BONDS ON THRESHOLD.
    % These values correspond to the minimal and maximal values that a
    % threshold is allowed to have. They have the format
    % SmallestThreshold,HighestThreshold
    % For SmallestThreshold you should use the value obtained in c). Leaving
    % the maximal value at 1 has worked fine for us all the time. Setting a
    % minimal value will prevent recognition of the background as an object
    %

    %
    % How it works>
    % This is a heavily adjusted version of the original IdentifySecondary module
    % It also has lower memory requirements and fixes some bugs of the original
    % module (shrinkage of nuclei, expansion of surrounding objects discarded by
    % DiscardSinglePixel)
    %
    % 0) Obtain masks with proper foreground objects.
    %
    % 1)sequential watershedding
    %
    % 2)Then one label image is constructed. If a pixel is part of different
    % objects at given threshold (which is likely in cell rich regions), it will be
    % allocated to the threshold which was defined prior. eg. if thresholds
    % specifications were 1 and 0.5 it would be attributed to the object
    % identified with a threshold of 1. If threshold specification was 0.5 1
    % it would be attributed to the object identified at 0.5
    %
    % 3) Cleaning up step. It could happen that an object would end up
    % separated into multiple fragments (which in most cases would be
    % biologically meaningless). Thus all fragments except the one, which
    % includes the primary object, are set to background

            %%% BUG WORKAROUND:
            %%% There is a bug in the watershed function of Matlab that often results in
            %%% the label matrix result having two objects labeled with the same label.
            %%% I am not sure whether it is a bug in how the watershed image is
            %%% produced (it seems so: the resulting objects often are nowhere near the
            %%% regional minima) or whether it is simply a problem in the final label
            %%% matrix calculation. Matlab has been informed of this issue and has
            %%% confirmed that it is a bug (February 2004). I think that it is a
            %%% reasonable fix to convert the result of the watershed to binary and
            %%% remake the label matrix so that each label is used only once. In later
            %%% steps, inappropriate regions are weeded out anyway.
